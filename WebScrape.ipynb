       "  'article': 'AdvertisementSupported byByLawrence UlrichTHE last year in automobiles could have been mistaken for an episode of “Survivor,” only set in the urban jungle of Detroit rather than some tropical backwater.As industry players retrenched and gritted their teeth for challenges to come, the 2010 season featured heroes and villains, new alliances, narrow escapes and thrilling reversals of fortune.For some played-out brands, there was no room on the shrinking island. General Motors shut down its Pontiac division, while Ford Motor began closing the doors of its redundant Mercury brand.Business remained miserable, just not as miserable as 2009, when the industry’s 10.4 million sales were the worst since 1982. With this year’s tally inching back to roughly 11.5 million, as projected by Edmunds.com, many automakers can, and will, crow about double-digit increases. But compared with the 16 million to 17 million sales that were routine before the recession, that’s akin to boasting that this year, you broke only one rib while getting punched in the gut.The tight credit that had crimped sales in 2009 loosened a bit. Experian Automotive reported that subprime loans rose in the third quarter while delinquencies fell, the first time either had happened since 2007. But the value of outstanding car loans dropped by $38 billion in the quarter, a sign that many Americans are holding onto their cars and steering clear of dealerships.For heroes and high ratings, it was hard to top Ford’s Alan Mulally Jr., the former chief executive of Boeing’s commercial airplanes division who oversaw Ford’s brisk return to profitability \\x97 and with no need for the government’s largess as at G.M. and Chrysler. That independence left Ford with no small measure of public good will, and consumers snapped up enough Mustangs, Fusions and F-150s to add billions to Ford’s bottom line.Having demonstrated such skill in turning around the Ford family’s auto interests, perhaps Mr. Mulally would consider taking over the Detroit Lions as well \\x97 this time sidelining the branch of the Fords that has haplessly managed the team. (Then again, some challenges may be too great.)There were ostensible villains and losers as well. Toyota’s sales stalled as the company sought to limit damage from its unintended acceleration snafu and the resulting recalls of 7.8 million Toyota and Lexus vehicles for pedal-snagging floormats and sticky accelerators. Yet some self-serving attempts by Toyota’s rivals to rewrite history \\x97 as though Toyota’s first major quality hiccup erased decades of proven reliability and consumer trust \\x97 carried a whiff of wishful thinking.Still, if any company seems determined to restore the old order in 2011, it’s Toyota. Despite $49 million in federal fines, and with the recall frenzy fading from the headlines, Toyota by December had regained the No. 1 spot on consumers’ shopping lists, according to Edmunds.com.But even if its competitors laid on a too-thick helping of schadenfreude at times, Toyota’s disgrace led some once-loyal customers to expand their shopping horizons and recognize a growing truth: Detroit continues to make strides in quality, performance and fuel economy, to the point that models like the Ford Fusion Hybrid, in the eyes of auto critics, can better their Asian counterparts.The “new” G.M. shot back from bankruptcy into profitability, leaving opponents \\x97 including politicians and states friendly to foreign automakers \\x97 looking a bit Grinchy this holiday season for prematurely kicking dirt on G.M.’s grave and arguing to put its workers on unemployment lines.To begin shedding its toxic Government Motors nickname, G.M. led a $23 billion initial public stock offering that reduced the federal stake from 61 percent to 33 percent. But G.M. stock will still have to reach lofty heights if American taxpayers are to recoup their entire involuntary investment in the auto industry.New alliances provided ongoing entertainment, with prospects for either juicy disasters or stirring comebacks. The Chrysler-Fiat arranged marriage paired a blue-collar Midwesterner with an Italian sugar daddy, while Volvo’s new reality, having been dropped from Ford’s portfolio, began with lessons in Chinese under its new tutor, Geely.Victor Muller, the entrepreneur who founded the modern Spyker, a tiny Dutch sports-car company, may be the year’s ultimate underdog. If Mr. Muller can somehow rescue the floundering Swedish automaker after acquiring it from G.M., he may join Carlos Ghosn of Nissan and Lee A. Iacocca of Chrysler on the short list of industry saviors.Chrysler, perhaps feeling the heat from G.M. and Ford’s in-progress turnarounds, sought to remind the public that it was still here and retooling to earn its own profits. On sale next year in select Chrysler dealerships, the perky Fiat 500 minicar will be the Fiat brand’s return to America after a 19-year absence.And the Ford Explorer, along with Chrysler’s Jeep Grand Cherokee \\x97 once the S.U.V. kings of America, though all but living in exile in recent years \\x97 are staging comeback attempts with smartly redesigned models that emphasize on-road handling and fuel economy rather than mountain-scaling skills.Hyundai of South Korea continued its inexorable rise, setting another annual record with more than 530,000 sales, thanks to warmly received, recession-friendly models like the Sonata. By itself, that new midsize sedan improved sales by more than 90,000 units over last year, the biggest jump in volume for any single nameplate.G.M.’s Buick, riding its new LaCrosse and Regal sedans, posted a roughly 51 percent improvement, tops among major car brands.Audi also sold a record number of cars in America, asserting itself as perhaps the most formidable luxury up-and-comer against the more traditional segment leaders, BMW and Mercedes.But Audi’s parent, Volkswagen, displaying breathtaking chutzpah, continued to insist that it could triple its American sales by 2018, despite the continuing market slump and the rise of the Koreans. To that end, Volkswagen is wrapping up a new $1 billion plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., its first in the United States since closing its short-lived Pennsylvania factory in 1988.Stable gas prices proved, again, that Americans prefer big even when their wallets feel small. Light truck sales, which includes pickups, minivans, S.U.V.’s and many crossovers, were on track to rise 17 percent. Yet hybrids dropped 8 percent, while small cars grew about 1 percent, according to projections by Edmunds.com.Despite that chilly reception, automakers rolled out tiny models in anticipation of 2015 fuel economy standards and potential fuel price spikes. Detroit began to persuade people that it could compete in small cars. Ford’s Fiesta hatchback arrived to favorable reviews, and its larger European stablemate, a sparkling all-new Focus, will finally come to America this spring. Chevrolet’s Cruze represented G.M.’s latest bid for respect in a class still ruled by Japanese brands.Automakers downsized engines as they upped the technology, adding direct fuel injection, turbocharging or supercharging to replace less thrifty engines of more size and cylinders. And 4-cylinder engines were showing up in the oddest places, from the Buick Regal to a forthcoming Explorer.But more than anything, it was the year of the electric car. The first customers for the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in hybrid, and the Nissan Leaf, a battery-only E.V., received their cars in December. No models last year received more attention, adulation or skepticism, or incited as many Internet brawls. For the first time in years, green-car talk focused on G.M. and Nissan, rather than Toyota.11 PhotosView Slide Show›If plug-in cars finally gain a lasting foothold, serving notice to BP and OPEC alike that there’s a new player in town, 2010 will be remembered as a watershed year. Early adopters entered a strange new world of grappling with red tape and permits to install home-charging docks, many subsidized through government grants. Companies, also backed by Energy Department financing, prepared to install E.V. charging stations, from major cities and highway corridors to Walgreens and Cracker Barrel restaurants, hoping to have 12,000 in operation by the end of 2011.And with Chevy and Nissan splashing into the plug-in pool, and Ford, Toyota, Honda and others to follow, there may be long-term ripples for more than consumers. Smaller E.V. start-ups \\x97 a mix of Tucker-esque visionaries, well-meaning strivers and a few outright charlatans \\x97 may face even longer odds against international automakers, with their trusted names and vast resources in engineering, marketing and service networks.That hasn’t deterred newcomers like Fisker or Tesla, which began spending $1 billion in government loans to speed more luxurious electron-powered cars to market. Tesla went public in 2010, and its shareholders will check their watches for the Model S, a roughly $50,000 electric sedan that’s supposed to arrive in 2012.Even the world’s most prestigious makers \\x97 Porsche, Mercedes, Ferrari, Jaguar, Audi and more \\x97 began engaging in electric one-upmanship. All showed either fully electric or hybrid models, with many destined for showrooms. The Porsche 918 Spyder Hybrid, a concept unveiled at the Geneva auto show that Porsche says will go 198 m.p.h. and return to 78 m.p.g., was perhaps the year’s best fantasy of guilt-free performance. It should be, with an estimated $600,000 price tag.Back in the real world, a moment of silence, please, for the hundreds of thousands of automaker employees, dealers and related workers who were cast aside for the future health of their companies. Michigan, which since 2000 has lost some 850,000 jobs, mostly in manufacturing, is expected to break the depressing streak and add jobs in each of the next two years, according to University of Michigan economists.And from automakers, factories and suppliers to dealers, advertising agencies, rental counters and finally consumers, the clear hope is that the recovery gains more traction in 2011. If that happens, car fans will watch 2010 recede in their mirrors, and not miss it a bit.Advertisement'},\n",

Mr. Jiménez, a 71-year-old San Antonio native, converted the German and Polish polkas and waltzes learned by his grandfather \\x97 and later transformed by his father into conjunto music, a Mexican strain born in the United States \\x97 into Tex-Mex, his own hybrid of bilingual honky-tonk.But Mr. Jiménez didn’t stop there. He brought that music out of the cantina and into the rock ’n’ roll fold, most notably with Doug Sahm, a fellow Texan, but also with Ry Cooder, a renowned salvager of bygone regional music, and even with the Rolling Stones. In short, Mr. Jiménez made the old-fashioned instrument relevant again, and he continues to inspire musicians to forgo the allure of the electric guitar for the squeezebox.Which squeezebox? A good starting point in your accordion research is theNew Year’s Eve Best of Texas Live concert. It will be a rare chance to see Mr. Jiménez, a five-time Grammy winner, play his glittery gold Corona II signature accordion, which was created last year by Hohner and is available to be bought.Boneshakers, Dec. 31, 7 p.m. boneshakersonline.comHOUSTONAn Electrifying EveTim Burton could not have dreamed up a New Year’s Eve celebration as extravagant asGloworama. Organizers of the free event in downtown Houston have a “more is more” philosophy that captivates the masses.Why stop at the standard entertainment fare, like ice skating and live music, when you can have a parade of art cars, dueling Tesla coils projecting 12-foot rays of electricity and a video display projected onto the George R. Brown Convention Center that vacillates between looking like an M. C. Escher drawing come to life and an Acid Test at its peak? How about some street performers and fireworks, too? While you’re at it, why not encourage everyone to dress outlandishly?Even if there’s no ball dropping at midnight, it’s doubtful you’ll miss it amid this conglomeration of high-octane spectacle.Discovery Green, Dec. 31, 7 p.m gloworama.comFREDERICKSBURGA Great SaunterDon’t waste time getting started on your resolution to exercise more: Lace up for the Midnight Volkssport Walk in Fredericksburg. Thissix-mile rambleis a New Year’s Eve tradition.Your motivation, should you need some, will be a wine and cheese social before the walk, an excuse to roam through a pretty Hill Country town rich with German heritage (keep your eye out for the large German Christmas pyramid with rotating nativity scene) and, at the finish, a limited-edition stamp to commemorate the experience. (Members of theAmerican Volkssport Association, an offshoot of a German sporting organization for nonprofessional athletes, keep a Volkssport passport of sorts to document their accomplishments.)“Our oldest walker is a German lady who is about 92,” said Phyllis Eagan, the event’s organizer. In other words, you really have no excuse not to participate.St. Joseph’s Halle, Dec. 31, midnight. walktexas.orgAUSTINA Bluesy New YearTwenty years after Stevie Ray Vaughan died in a helicopter crash and cut short a trailblazing blues career, his older brother and guitar tutor is hitting yet another groove in his own career.We last heard from Jimmie Vaughan as a soloist with the release of his Grammy-winning album “Do You Get the Blues?” That was nine years, a pair of twin daughters, and a duet album with Omar Kent Dykes ago. But rust did not set in on Mr. Vaughan, whose subsequent album, “Jimmie Vaughan Plays Blues, Ballads & Favorites,” out last summer, just scored a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional Blues Album. It’s mostly a covers record: retro-sounding, jazz-inflected takes on songs from Mr. Vaughan’s days growing up in Oak Cliff. “We wanted it to sound like it was coming out of a jukebox,” he said.Mr. Vaughan, an Austin resident, plays live all the time, but rarely with the Tilt a Whirl band on his new album. That means a horns section and the vocal interplay of Lou Ann Barton, his longtime running mate, on New Year’s Eve atAntone’s, the blues club Ms. Barton and Mr. Vaughan helped put on the map in the ’70s.Antone’s, Dec. 31, 9 p.m.antones.netDALLASTraining DayThe mall may seem like the last place you want to be right now, but this is the final weekend of The Trains atNorthPark, the annual exhibit of electric model trains, upgraded this year to 1,600 square feet of track on a 4,000-square-foot tableau rife with United States landmarks.NorthPark Center, Dec. 31 -Jan. 2, various times.northparkcenter.comSOUTH PADRE ISLANDBarely Bear-ableJoin participants in the annualSouth Padre Island Polar Bear Dipand be reborn when you masochistically submerge yourself into hypothermia-inducing ocean water on the first day of the new year.Boomerang Billy’s Beach Bar and Grill, Jan. 1, noon.Advertisement'},\n",

       "  'article': 'For technology start-ups, the initial public offering has long lost the sheen of the dot-com era, when it seemed like anyone with an idea could go public. At the peak of the bubble, the Silicon Valley factory was in\\n                                        overdrive, pumping out hundreds of I.P.O.’s. a year.In the wake of the financial crisis, there were just 45 offerings of tech companies in 2010, according to investment firm Renaissance Capital. The year before, only 16 debuted.Now, Silicon Valley could see a modest return to the prerecession days — and even a hot brand-name initial offering from the likes of Groupon, Facebook or Zynga analysts say.“If the equity markets remain stable, I expect a solid I.P.O. market,” said Peter Falvey, co-head of technology investment banking for Morgan Keegan. “We could see 20 percent more deals by value\\n                                        and by number.” Mr. Falvey and others also see increasing odds for a “Death Star explosion” — a blockbuster, multibillion dollar offering from a major Internet company. That theory gained\\n                                        credence on Thursday, when DealBookreportedthat that social-buying site Groupon is preparing for to I.P.O. at the end of 2011.Silicon Valley is waking from a deep slumber.The credit crisis paralyzed the technology I.P.O. market, as investors shunned unproven ventures. Only 20 companies went public from 2008 to the end of 2009, according to data from Renaissance Capital.Meanwhile, initial offerings have become less attractive to young entrepreneurs who do not want to be burdened with the costly bureaucratic challenges of going public, including increased regulatory scrutiny, constant\\n                                        filings and high investment banking fees.Instead, more founders are delaying initial offerings in favor of additional venture capital. Facebook raised more than half a billion dollars from the Russian firm Digital Sky Technologies. As DealBook noted, Groupon\\n                                        is negotiating with Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and Morgan Stanley for another round of financing that could be as large as $950 million.Still, several analysts say I.P.O.’s may be regaining favor again, thanks to the improving stock market and a better economic environment.“We may be nearing an inflection point,” said Paul Bard, a vice president at Renaissance Capital. “Companies are feeling good about their businesses, the buy side is more interested in growth and\\n                                        new money is coming into the market. When you have those three things happening in concert, that creates the potential for a very vibrant market for tech I.P.O.’s.”The market may also be supported by the steady flow of Chinese companies, looking to go public on American exchanges. Eleven technology companies based in China had initial public offerings in the United States this\\n                                        year, including DangDang, an online retailer that experienced higher-than-expected demand in its debut, raising $272 million.After a sluggish start, I.P.O. performance and pricing has picked up in the second half of this year. The shares of technology companies that have recently gone public are up 50.3 percent from their initial offer price,\\n                                        according to Morgan Keegan.Although there are a few well-known names in this group, including the electric-car marker Tesla, the vast majority are little known, small-cap stocks. And some have done very well.Shares of the software maker RealPage, which began trading in August, have roughly doubled. RealD, the 3-D technology company that went public in July, is up 60 percent.The average first-day increase in share price was 18 percent, said Mr. Bard, adding that the recent rally would encourage small and midsize tech start-ups to take the plunge next year. He says he expects 2011 I.P.O.\\n                                        activity for technology stocks to match the levels of the years preceding the recession. In those years, the market averaged 53 public offerings a year with a value of $9.6 billion, according to Renaissance Capital.There are 22 companies in the tech I.P.O. pipeline, including the Web chat serviceSkype, which many predict will be a billion-dollar\\n                                        offering.The latest parlor game, however, is placing bets on whether Internet companies like Groupon or Facebook, which already have multibillion-dollar valuations, will join the fray. There has been significant demand for these\\n                                        Web darlings in the secondary markets, private exchanges that match buyers and sellers, including former employees looking to sell their stock. Facebook, at the center of the frenzy, is trading at an implied valuation\\n                                        of $42.4 billion, according to SharesPost.Although the company’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that he is in no rush to go public, the company may face increased pressure in the near term. As more investors pile into Facebook shares, often through\\n                                        special investment pools, the company could soon surpass 500 shareholders. That milestone wouldsubject the companyto a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that would require Facebook to register with the S.E.C. and submit financial results.As DealBookreported, the S.E.C. has started to ask for information about secondary-market trading in the shares of Facebook,\\n                                        Twitter, Zynga and LinkedIn.If Groupon or Facebook, or one of their peers, do go public in 2011, Mr. Falvey said it would be a game changer for the industry.“There’s a chance that you get that Death Star I.P.O. in the tech market that draws huge attention to I.P.O.’s,,” he said, “the kind of attention we haven’t seen since the tech\\n                                        bubble burst in 2000.”'},\n",

The company’s first car, the Roadster, enticed the likes of theGoogleco-founderLarry PageandGeorge Clooneyto drop $100,000 in 2006 for the “wicked fast” vehicle. Three years later, the company unveiled the Model S, an all-electric\\n                                        car that the company is developing withToyota. The hope is\\n                                        that the vehicle will be available in 2012 for less than $50,000.But despite all the hype, Tesla has never been a financial hit. The Silicon Valley start-up, founded in 2003, has never turned a profit — and it is not expected to do so until 2012.Concerns persist about the potential demand. Carter Driscoll, an analyst at Capstone Investments, recently wrote that he didn’t think the company would grow as quickly as the market anticipated, as consumers\\n                                        would be slow to adopt the new technology. He has a sell on the stock, with a price target of $22, roughly 14 percent below its current level.“I just think that there were a lot more risks than there were positives at the price it was at,” he said.But even Mr. Driscoll said he didn’t expect the price to drop so precipitously.“As an analyst you want things to unfold because you think the things you highlighted as risks materialized, not just because you just snapped your fingers,” Mr. Driscoll said. “I mean, do people\\n                                        really want to hate this company? Did I miss some vitriol?”Of course, it didn’t help the stock that the lock-up period ended just after Christmas amid a blizzard, which damped trading volumes.As early investors finish taking their profits, some analysts expect the stock will settle — and the price could even get a small boost.“I’d expect to see some of that come back a little bit as excitement over being able to sell the stock kind of wears thin,” said Dave Hurst, a senior analyst at Pike Research in Boulder. “I’m\\n                                        not sure we’ll get up to the height we saw with the I.P.O., but I feel like we’re in for a few days of tumbling here, and then you’ll see it bounce back.”'},\n",

       "  'article': 'AdvertisementSupported byByDon ShermanDetroitTHE great economic quake of ’08 rattled Detroit mightily, wreaking severe damage to the foundation of the American auto industry. Bankruptcies at Chrysler and General Motors, resulting in drastic cuts at the automakers and their suppliers, dominated the headlines day after day.Behind the front-page news were the more personal stories of job losses \\x97 hundreds of thousands across the industry, according to the Labor Department \\x97 that were part of the aftershocks. Even so, some who found themselves on the outside discovered that their talents were in demand elsewhere.Instead of playing musical chairs with competitors or starting down entirely new career paths where their knowledge and experience might not be so highly valued, many of these Detroit graduates have found greener pastures at electric car start-ups and suppliers.Technological advances in batteries, motors and electronic controls have created new possibilities for electric-car ventures. After plodding along for two decades, the carmaking operations are accelerating with the help of a new business model: small, agile organizations aided by a network of outside suppliers, developers and consultants.That’s good news for the engineers and executives with the expertise needed to move this emerging technology out of the lab, down an assembly line and into customers’ hands.Credit the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for greasing the skids at the manufacturer level. Nearly $3 billion in loans and grants helped firms developing electric, hybrid-electric and alternative-fuel vehicles gain momentum. The companies, in turn, often hired former Detroit 3 employees who had the required skills.The downturn made available proven leaders like Jim Taylor, who, after a 30-year career on small and large engineering teams, was ready for a change. One of the first dozen employees of G.M.’s Saturn division, then later the head of Cadillac and Hummer, Mr. Taylor had enjoyed more highs than lows. After leaving G.M., he joined Amp Electric Vehicles, an Ohio start-up whose ranks include members of the team that developed G.M.’s EV1 electric car in the 1990s, as the firm’s vice chairman and chief executive.“The opportunities here range from the conversion of existing cars to electric drive to establishing new relationships with major manufacturers to help develop electric-propulsion components,” Mr. Taylor said in a telephone interview. “All the experience I gained at G.M. prepared me well for this environment, where there are far more questions than answers.”He’ll have plenty to do. A utility in Iceland recently hired Amp to provide 1,000 electric S.U.V.’s, and Michigan-based DTE Energy wants Amp to electrify part of its fleet.Tom Reichenbach, chief engineer at Aptera, an electric car maker, is another Detroit graduate thriving in this emerging field. Though he lacked electric-car experience, Mr. Reichenbach spent the last half of his 26-year stint at Ford working on high-stakes racing and high-performance projects. As engineering manager for the Special Vehicles Team, he helped to develop the Ford GT and the Mustang Shelby GT500. And until he left two years ago, he was assistant chief engineer for the EcoBoost V-6 engine.“I was lucky to enjoy a string of fascinating projects,” Mr. Reichenbach said. “But when the downturn hit and Ford was into a fourth round of layoffs, I updated my résumé. When my boss mentioned that, at 56, I was eligible for retirement, I knew I was in trouble.”He added: “Everyone in Detroit experienced a scare when gas prices spiked and buying habits changed overnight. But I lost faith in Ford’s future when the company’s entire electric vehicle team was part of the first round of engineering layoffs.”Looking for a challenge less dependent on petroleum supplies, Mr. Reichenbach interviewed at two electric-car start-ups, Aptera and Fisker. Tesla Motors, also on his list, was not hiring when he went prospecting for a new job.Aptera’s outlook convinced Mr. Reichenbach it was a company where he could thrive. “Their business plan was modest, and their growth prospects were geared to cash flow,” he recalled. “Aptera’s desire to build a light and aerodynamically efficient \\x97 albeit unusual looking \\x97 car made sense.”He said his new job “is way more fun and rewarding than working at Ford,” adding, “The four-year incubation times there were torture.”Two of Mr. Reichenbach’s colleagues are also Detroit expats. When Steve Fambro and Chris Anthony, the Southern California dreamers who started Aptera, needed help, they recruited Paul Wilbur. His 26 years of experience with Ford, Chrysler and two specialty firms, ASC and Saleen, qualified him to be president and chief executive. A few months later, a chief marketing officer, Marques McCammon, was hired; he had previously worked at Chrysler, ASC and Saleen.Farther up the California coast, Tesla also tapped the Detroit talent pool. The chief financial officer, Deepak Ahuja, came from Ford. The chief designer, Franz von Holzhausen, is an alumnus of G.M., where he won credit for creating two sports cars, the Pontiac Solstice and the Saturn Sky.Fisker Automotive, a developer of high-end hybrids based in Irvine, Calif., recently hired Linda Theisen as vice president for purchasing. During 20 years at Ford, she worked in North America and Europe. “I’m enjoying much less bureaucracy and far more accountability,” Ms. Theisen said. “We get data, make decisions and move without over-analyzing. It’s a much quicker environment than what I experienced in Detroit.”Another California start-up, Coda Automotive, recruited experts who spent years at G.M. Broc TenHouten, a senior engineering vice president, brought chassis design and development experience to the Chinese-made sedans fitted with electric powertrains that the company plans to sell. Coda’s battery systems vice president, Philippe Gow, cut his engineering teeth developing batteries for G.M.’s EV1. Coda’s drive system is provided by UQM Technologies, a Colorado company headed by Eric Ridenour; until 2007, he was Chrysler’s chief operating officer responsible for engineering, manufacturing, quality and product strategy.The battery industry, growing rapidly in response to demand, is also peppered with former Detroit 3 executives. Mary Ann Wright was ahead of the curve when she joined Johnson Controls, a leading auto industry supplier, in 2007, after a high-profile career at Ford. She once led the development of the Escape Hybrid and Ford’s fuel-cell demonstration fleet. Now she is vice president for technology and innovation at Johnson Controls’ new power solutions division.“I decided to focus on sustainable mobility during my time at Ford,” Ms. Wright said. “Johnson Controls was an attractive destination not only because it’s the world’s largest battery provider, but also because it’s financially sound, socially responsible and deeply committed to environmental sustainability.”Several other Ford graduates hold high-level positions at competing battery makers. At A123 Systems, Mujeeb Ijaz is an engineering director and Geoff Taylor is vice president for quality. Prabhakar Patil, a former colleague of Ms. Wright, is chief executive of LG Chem’s North American battery-making subsidiary; Martin Klein, previously of Ford, is engineering director.G.M. has also been a training ground for the ranks of battery companies. Bob Purcell, who once headed the advanced technology group that created the EV1, was recently named chairman of Protean Holdings, a maker of in-wheel electric motors.“What we electric-car veterans contribute besides our expertise is a higher level of confidence that a given program will be properly executed,” Mr. Purcell said. “Since we understand how the decision-making and validation processes work inside the large companies, we’re more able to meet ambitious cost and performance targets.”After a 30-year G.M. career, Jon Bereisa, systems architect for the EV1 and the Volt, is keeping his options open as a consultant. He is helping one of his clients, Magna E-Car Systems, investigate lithium-ion battery design and manufacturing options. Magna also developed the software and powertrain components for the 2012 Ford Focus Electric. Instead of expanding its engineering staff for that project, Ford turned to a proven supplier already working on electric cars for other makers.“It’s not as if I walked out of G.M. to grab a fishing pole and never come back,” Mr. Bereisa said. “Basically, I just moved upstream, from a car manufacturing organization to the more specialized technology companies which are striving to make electric vehicles truly practical.”Advertisement'},\n",

The new film, which chronicles ongoing E.V. roll-outs through profiles of key industry players, will be released\\n                                        late next spring, though its trailer has already been produced.Mr. Paine leveraged social media to create some buzz last Friday by posting the preview only after 10,000 people had clicked “Like” on the film’sFacebookpage.“2011 and 2012 are critical years for theelectric car,”\\n                                        said Mr. Paine, an unabashed E.V. booster, who noted in conversation that the first Chevrolet Volts and Nissan Leafs have been delivered. “The game is on, and I’d like to see the new film help get\\n                                        us off oil and build momentum for the new generation of cars.

Mr. Paine, who drives aTesla Roadster,\\n                                        called the Leaf and Volt “pretty strong entries.” He continued, saying that “There’s no way that anyone is making money on these first cars, but they didn’t make anything on the\\n                                        first Priuses, either.”Mr. Paine said he had shot 400 hours of film, and though he was in the latter stages of editing, he was still shooting. The film will have a theatrical release and may be showcased at festivals, but Mr. Paine and his\\n                                        producers are also considering “a multiplatform, international world premiere” that would enable viewing via Netflix stream or download to PC oriPad.A team of New York Times contributors blogs about news, trends and all things automotive.

       "  'article': 'Toyota’s urban electric car, shown in various guises at auto shows, will be based on the diminutive iQ when it arrives in Europe, Japan and the United States in 2012, the company says. Journalists in Japan drove\\n                                        prototypes of the car recently at Mega Web, a showroom with a small test track run by the Toyota Motor Corporation in Tokyo.The iQ will be sold as a Scion in the United States when it goes on sale early next year, but Toyota did not say whether the electric car would also wear the Scion badge.“We’re not sure yet how many will go to which markets, and not sure how it will be marketed,” said John Hanson, a Toyota spokesman. “But it will arrive in 2012, at the same time as the electric\\n                                        RAV4 and the plug-in hybrid Prius.”A series of “road trials” of the electric iQ will begin in the three introductory markets next year, and sales in China are also under consideration.Mr. Hanson said Toyota would have a “wide variety of programs” to help it meet coming environmental regulations. Between 2012 and 2015, it will introduce not only the electric iQ, but also a much-publicized\\n                                        plug-in hybrid and a fuel-cell car. The companywill also bring out 11 new or redesigned hybrid modelsby the end of 2012. The electric RAV4, developed\\n                                        with Tesla Motors, wasunveiled at the Los Angeles auto showlast week.Toyota also said Thursday that it was continuing development of its fuel-cell sedan, which Mr. Hanson said would go on sale “in 2015 or earlier.” The company said “a price under 10 million yen seems\\n                                        attainable,” which set off some alarm bells because that translates into more than $120,000.But Mr. Hanson said the company planned to sharply cut production costs for its fuel-cell car by the time it reaches the market.“We obviously have to reduce costs further, and that will be done in a lot of different ways,” he said. “We’re talking about a vehicle we want to sell in volume, so it can’t have an\\n                                        exotic-car price. The figure the company cited is simply where we are right now, but remember we used to call fuel-cell cars ‘million-dollar’ vehicles.”A team of New York Times contributors blogs about news, trends and all things automotive.

       "  'article': 'Steven L. Rattner, asPresident Obama’s former auto bailout chief, worked withGeneral Motorsas it struggled to find its footing amid a bankruptcy reorganization in 2008. During that time, the company was also developing theChevrolet Volt, an innovative plug-in hybrid car that is going on sale\\n                                        soon.In his new book, “Overhaul,” Mr. Rattner, whofaces legal troublesunrelated\\n                                        to his work on the auto task force, writes that the Volt, which is priced at $41,000, is costing around $40,000 apiece to build. “At least in the early years, each Volt would cost around $40,000 to manufacture\\n                                        (development costs not included),” he writes.In an interview a couple of weeks ago, Mr. Rattner said he had learned of the Volt’s costs in the course of due diligence during the G.M. bankruptcy process. “I don’t know the precise number,”\\n                                        he said. G.M. was nonetheless “right to do it,” he added, even in the absence of profit, because the program helped quiet critics “who’ve said for many years that the company was behind\\n                                        the curve.”Rob Peterson, a G.M. spokesman, declined to disclose how much the Volt costs to build. “We haven’t released any numbers related to costs,” he said. But Mr. Peterson said that G.M. would benefit\\n                                        from the Volt program in many ways, including the use of its drivetrain components on other cars. “The importance of the Volt is more than a single profit-and-loss statement,” he said.G.M. has certainly accrued goodwill from the Volt. It was recently named Green Car of the Year at the Los Angeles Auto Show. But the economic challenges of such a costly program are clear. In his book about G.M., “Sixty\\n                                        to Zero,” Alex Taylor III, an editor at Fortune, writes that the Volt, which he describes as a billion-dollar development program, is “about as relevant to G.M.’s economic survival as an electric\\n                                        pogo stick.”Mr. Rattner agrees that the Volt program will be valuable for G.M., but he’s convinced thatelectric vehicleswill not be a profit center for automakers anytime soon. “E.V.’s are everybody’s latest fantasy,”\\n                                        he said. “No doubt they are important and they are real, but they won’t have an impact on profitability and sales for the foreseeable future.”Mr. Rattner also said that, despite the profit problem, established automakers were better positioned to sell electric cars than start-ups, likeTesla Motors. “E.V. markets will be dominated by the existing companies,” he said. “They have the scaled operations and the dealer\\n                                        networks. The idea that a bunch of E.V. companies will come along and G.M. and Ford will go out of business is kind of crazy.”Mr. Rattner’s legal problems are continuing. On Thursday,Andrew M. Cuomo,\\n                                        New York’s attorney general and governor-elect,formally accused Mr. Rattnerof engaging in a kickback scheme involving the state’s pension fund system. Mr. Cuomo is seeking from Mr. Rattner $26 million and a lifetime ban from the securities industry. On the same day, Mr. Rattner\\n                                        agreed to settleSecurities and Exchange Commissioncomplaints by paying a $3 million penalty and disgorging $3.2 million related to the accusations.

No other performances have been scheduled in the United States. The show had its premiere at the Manchester International Festival in England and has received ecstatic reviews from critics. Performed in the round, it features a 24-woman choir, a giant Tesla coil and several large custom-built instruments that Bjork and her collaborators invented: a portable pipe organ, four 10-foot pendulums that play harp notes as they swing, a gramophone-like contraption called a “Sharpsichord” and another piece called a “gameleste,” which is a fusion of a celesta and a gamelan.

The show’s mockery of “obscene wealth and the grandiosity that comes with giving back” is badly needed, Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. “A new cultural revolution is at hand, and many of its leaders are even more smug and self-righteous than the counterculture activists who, back in the 1960s, also thought they could change the world.” She added, “\\xa0‘Silicon Valley’ isn’t making the world a better place, it is putting the real Silicon Valley in its place, one Tesla at a time.” Above, from left, Kumail Nanjiani, Martin Starr, Thomas Middleditch, Zach Woods and T. J. Miller star in the show. The season opener of “Game of Thrones” leads in at 9; “Veep” follows at 10:30.',\n",

       "  'lead_paragraph': 'Feeling Lucky: To anybody who’s known a toddler, it might seem counterintuitive that the children’s picture book list at the moment is so stable and calm — seven of this week’s 10 entries have been on the list for six months or longer. (In some cases much longer: Hervé Tullet’s “Press Here” is coming up on four years.) That means that Dan Santat’s sweet story “The Adventures of Beekle,” about an imaginary friend in search of his human, is a relative newcomer: It’s No.\\u202f7 after 13 weeks. Santat’s book got a bump when it won the Caldecott Medal in February, setting it apart as last year’s “most distinguished American picture book.” The award caught Santat off guard, he told Publishers Weekly at the time. “I never really thought that I had a chance,” he said. “When I got the call, I hate to admit it, but I started crying. I crumpled to the floor and started crying.” Santat has illustrated other people’s books for a long time (he previously hit the list as the illustrator for Ahmet Zappa’s “Because I’m Your Dad,” in 2013), but “The Adventures of Beekle” is just the second story he’s written on his own. He almost chose not to, he told Publishers Weekly: Five years ago he had a chance to join Google, drawing doodles for the home page. “Should I take this job and make money to support my family,” he asked himself, “or should I chase my dream?” Turning Google down, he continued, “motivated me to use the other side of my creative brain, to write more.” It paid off. Among the highlights of Santat’s February, according to his Tumblr account, was outselling “50 Shades of Grey” (“for a brief moment”) and receiving the following Valentine’s “newsletter” from his 9-year-old son, Alek: “Dan Santat has just won his amazing Caldecott award. Many people think that Dan is known around the world.”',\n",
